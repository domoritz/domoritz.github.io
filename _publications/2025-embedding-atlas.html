Embedding projections are popular for visualizing large datasets and models.
However, people often encounter "friction" when using embedding visualization
tools: (1) barriers to adoption, e.g., tedious data wrangling and loading,
scalability limits, no integration of results into existing workflows, and (2)
limitations in possible analyses, without integration with external tools to
additionally show coordinated views of metadata. In this paper, we present
Embedding Atlas, a scalable, interactive visualization tool designed to make
interacting with large embeddings as easy as possible. Embedding Atlas uses
modern web technologies and advanced algorithms—including density-based
clustering, and automated labeling—to provide a fast and rich data analysis
experience at scale. We evaluate Embedding Atlas with a competitive analysis
against other popular embedding tools, showing that Embedding Atlas's feature
set specifically helps reduce friction, and report a benchmark on its real-time
rendering performance with millions of points. Embedding Atlas is available as
open source to support future work in embedding-based analysis.
