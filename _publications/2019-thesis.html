  While computers can help us manage data, human judgment and domain expertise
  is what turns it into understanding. Meeting the challenges of increasingly
  large and complex data requires methods that richly integrate the capabilities
  of both people and machines. In response to these challenges, this thesis
  contributes new languages and models for visualization design that power
  interactive systems for scalable data analysis.

  In these languages, users can be imprecise about low-level design decisions as
  the system leverages this ambiguity to optimize the visual design and
  necessary computation. Vega-Lite is a high-level declarative language for
  rapidly creating interactive visualizations, while also providing a convenient
  yet powerful representation for tools that generate visualizations. Vega-Lite
  uses smart defaults to fill in low-level details to create eective designs.
  The declarative design facilitates optimization of the required data
  processing. Draco is a model of visualization design that extends Vega-Lite
  with shareable design guidelines, formal reasoning over the design space, and
  visualization recommendation. We show how we can use Draco to construct
  increasingly sophisticated automated visualization design and recommendation
  systems, including systems based on weights learned directly from the results
  of graphical perception experiments.

  We take a user-centric perspective on systems for scalable exploratory
  analysis. Considering both the backend and frontend concerns, we present
  Falcon, an interactive crossfilter application where users can interact with
  billions of records without latencies that negatively affect their
  exploration. To scale beyond billions of records, we present Pangloss, a
  visual analysis system that uses approximate query processing but provides
  eventual guarantees using Optimistic Visualization. In this concept, we treat
  approximate query processing as a user experience problem to address users'
  primary concern: trust in their exploration results. Falcon and Pangloss
  contribute techniques for scalable interaction and exploration of large data
  volumes by making principled trade-os among people's latency tolerance,
  precomputation, and the level of approximation.
