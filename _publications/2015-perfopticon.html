Distributed database performance is often unpredictable due to issues such as
system complexity, network congestion, or imbalanced data distribution. These
issues are difficult for users to assess in part due to the opaque mapping
between declaratively specified queries and actual physical execution plans.
Database developers currently must expend significant time and effort scanning
log files to isolate and debug the root causes of performance issues. In
response, we present Perfopticon, an interactive query profiling tool that
enables rapid insight into common problems such as performance bottlenecks and
data skew. Perfopticon combines interactive visualizations of (1) query plans,
(2) overall query execution, (3) data flow among servers, and (4) execution
traces. These views coordinate multiple levels of abstraction to enable
detection, isolation, and understanding of performance issues. We evaluate our
design choices through engagements with system developers, scientists, and
students. We demonstrate that Perfopticon enables performance debugging for
real-world tasks.
