Creating effective visualizations requires domain familiarity as well as design
and analysis expertise, and may impose a tedious specification process. To
address these difficulties, many visualization tools complement manual
specification with recommendations. However, designing interfaces, ranking
metrics, and scalable recommender systems remain important research challenges.
In this paper, we propose a common framework for facilitating the development of
visualization recommender systems in the form of a specification language for
querying over the space of visualizations. We present the preliminary design of
CompassQL, which defines (1) a partial specification that describes enumeration
constraints, and (2) methods for choosing, ranking, and grouping recommended
visualizations. To demonstrate the expressivity of the language, we describe
existing recommender systems in terms of CompassQL queries. Finally, we discuss
the prospective benefits of a common language for future visualization
recommender systems.
