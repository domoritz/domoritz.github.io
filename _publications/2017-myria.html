In this paper, we present an overview of the Myria stack for big data management
and analytics that we developed in the database group at the University of
Washington and that we have been operating as a cloud service aimed at domain
scientists around the UW campus. We highlight Myria's key design choices and
innovations and report on our experience with using Myria for various data
science use-cases.
