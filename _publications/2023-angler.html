Machine learning (ML) models can fail in unexpected ways in the real world, but
not all model failures are equal. With finite time and resources, ML
practitioners are forced to prioritize their model debugging and improvement
efforts. Through interviews with 13 ML practitioners at Apple, we found that
practitioners construct small targeted test sets to estimate an error's nature,
scope, and impact on users. We built on this insight in a case study with
machine translation models, and developed Angler, an interactive visual
analytics tool to help practitioners prioritize model improvements. In a user
study with 7 machine translation experts, we used Angler to understand
prioritization practices when the input space is infinite, and obtaining
reliable signals of model quality is expensive. Our study revealed that
participants could form more interesting and user-focused hypotheses for
prioritization by analyzing quantitative summary statistics and qualitatively
assessing data by reading sentences.
