Space-restricted techniques for visualizing hierarchies generally achieve high
scalability and readability (e.g., tree maps, bundle views, sunburst). However,
the visualization layout directly depends on the hierarchy, that is, small
changes to the hierarchy can cause wide-ranging changes to the layout. For this
reason, it is difficult to use these techniques to compare similar variants of a
hierarchy because users are confronted with layouts that do not expose the
expected similarity. Voronoi treemaps appear to be promising candidates to
overcome this limitation. However, existing Voronoi treemap algorithms do not
provide deterministic layouts or assume a fixed hierarchy. In this paper we
present an extended layout algorithm for Voronoi treemaps that provides a high
degree of layout similiarity for varying hierarchies, such as software-system
hierarchies. The implementation uses a deterministic initial-distribution
approach that reduces the variation in node positioning even if changes in the
underlying hierarchy data occur. Compared to existing layout algorithms, our
algorithm achieves lower error rates with respect to node areas in the case of
weighted Voronoi diagrams, which we show in a comparative study.
