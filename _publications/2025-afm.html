We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power
Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: (i)
a~3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural
innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and
(ii) a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts
(PT-MoE) transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse
computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with
competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are
trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via
responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,
then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on
a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional
languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public
benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model
match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.

A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation,
constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to
integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements
in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with
safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our
commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud
Compute.
