Authors often transform a large screen visualization for smaller displays
through rescaling, aggregation and other techniques when creating visualizations
for both desktop and mobile devices (i.e., responsive visualization). However,
transformations can alter relationships or patterns implied by the large screen
view, requiring authors to reason carefully about what information to preserve
while adjusting their design for the smaller display. We propose an automated
approach to approximating the loss of support for task-oriented visualization
insights (identification, comparison, and trend) in responsive transformation of
a source visualization. We operationalize identification, comparison, and trend
loss as objective functions calculated by comparing properties of the rendered
source visualization to each realized target (small screen) visualization. To
evaluate the utility of our approach, we train machine learning models on human
ranked small screen alternative visualizations across a set of source
visualizations. We find that our approach achieves an accuracy of 84% (random
forest model) in ranking visualizations. We demonstrate this approach in a
prototype responsive visualization recommender that enumerates responsive
transformations using Answer Set Programming and evaluates the preservation of
task-oriented insights using our loss measures. We discuss implications of our
approach for the development of automated and semi-automated responsive
visualization recommendation.
