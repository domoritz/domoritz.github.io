Low latency interactive data visualizations of large volumes of data are still
rare on the web today. Their development requires expertise in server
development, API design, dataflow optimization, and browser technologies;
developers rarely have the time to optimize the whole stack from server to
browser. To lift the burden of client-server co-development, we propose a system
that generates visualization applications from declarative visualization and
interaction specifications. We envision a system that automatically optimizes a
visualization plan to reduce latencies, especially in low-connectivity or mobile
networks. In this paper, we investigate the design of automated techniques to
determine a partition of work across server and client that minimizes latency.
Our cost model is based on a combination of data statistics, network
performance, available computing resources, and predicted interactions. As a
preliminary evaluation of our approach, we describe how our system could work in
the context of two analysis scenarios.
