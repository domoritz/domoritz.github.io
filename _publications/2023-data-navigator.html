Making data visualizations accessible for people with disabilities remains a
significant challenge in current practitioner efforts. Existing visualizations
often lack an underlying navigable structure, fail to engage necessary input
modalities, and rely heavily on visual-only rendering practices. These
limitations exclude people with disabilities, especially users of assistive
technologies. To address these challenges, we present Data Navigator: a system
built on a dynamic graph structure, enabling developers to construct navigable
lists, trees, graphs, and flows as well as spatial, diagrammatic, and geographic
relations. Data Navigator supports a wide range of input modalities: screen
reader, keyboard, speech, gesture detection, and even fabricated assistive
devices. We present 3 case examples with Data Navigator, demonstrating we can
provide accessible navigation structures on top of raster images, integrate with
existing toolkits at scale, and rapidly develop novel prototypes. Data Navigator
is a step towards making accessible data visualizations easier to design and
implement.
