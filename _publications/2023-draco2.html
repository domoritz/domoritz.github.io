Draco introduced a constraint-based framework to model visualization design in
an extensible and testable form. It provides a way to abstract design guidelines
from theoretical and empirical studies and applies the knowledge in automated
design tools. However, Draco is challenging to use because there is limited
tooling and documentation. In response, we present Draco 2, the successor with
(1) a more flexible visualization specification format, (2) a comprehensive test
suite and documentation, and (3) flexible and convenient APIs. We designed Draco
2 to be more extensible and easier to integrate into visualization systems. We
demonstrate these advantages and believe that they make Draco 2 a platform for
future research.
