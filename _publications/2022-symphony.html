Interfaces for machine learning (ML), information and visualiza-tions about
models or data, can help practitioners build robust andresponsible ML systems.
Despite their benefits, recent studies of ML teams and our interviews with
practitioners (n=9) showed that ML interfaces have limited adoption in practice.
While existing MLinterfaces are effective for specific tasks, they are not
designed tobe reused, explored, and shared by multiple stakeholders in
cross-functional teams. To enable analysis and communication between different
ML practitioners, we designed and implemented Symphony, a framework for
composing interactive ML interfaces withtask-specific, data-driven components
that can be used across plat-forms such as computational notebooks and web
dashboards. We developed Symphonythrough participatory design sessions with 10
teams (n=31), and discuss our findings from deploying Symphony to 3 production
ML projects at Apple. Symphony helped ML practitioners discover previously
unknown issues like data duplicates and blind spots in models while enabling
them to share insightswith other stakeholders.
