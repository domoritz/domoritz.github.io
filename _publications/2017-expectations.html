Pangloss implements "Optimistic Visualization", a method that gives analysts
confidence to use approximate results for exploratory data analysis. In this
paper, we outline how analysts' experience with an approximate visualization
system did not match their intuitions. These observations have implications for
the design of future data exploration systems that expose uncertainty. We also
describe requirements for approximate query engines to enable the next
generation of exploratory visualization systems.
