Pangloss implements "Optimistic Visualization", a method that gives analysts
confidence to use approximate results for exploratory data analysis. In this
position paper, we outline some ways in which user experiences with an
approximate visualization system did not match analysts' intuitions. These
observations have implications for the design of future systems that expose
uncertainty to users.
