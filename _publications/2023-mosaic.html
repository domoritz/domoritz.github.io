Mosaic is an architecture for greater scalability, extensibility, and
interoperability of interactive data views. Mosaic decouples data processing
from specification logic: clients publish their data needs as declarative
queries that are then managed and optimized by a coordinator that proxies access
to a scalable data store. Mosaic generalizes Vega-Lite's selection abstraction
to enable rich integration and linking of both standalone components (including
menus, text search, and tables) and visualizations created using vgplot, a
grammar of interactive graphics in which graphical marks act as Mosaic clients.
We demonstrate Mosaic's expressiveness, extensibility, and interoperability
through examples that compose diverse visualization, interaction, and
optimization techniques. To evaluate scalability, we present benchmark studies
with order-of-magnitude performance improvements over existing web-based
visualization systems -- enabling flexible, real-time visual exploration of
billion+ record datasets. We conclude by discussing Mosaic's potential as an
open platform that bridges visualization languages, scalable visualization, and
interactive data systems more broadly.
