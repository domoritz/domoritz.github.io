We contribute user-centered prefetching and indexing methods that provide
low-latency interactions across linked visualizations, enabling cold-start
exploration of billion-record datasets. We implement our methods in Falcon, a
web-based system that makes principled trade-os between latency and resolution
to optimize brushing and view switching times. To optimize latency-sensitive
brushing actions, Falcon reindexes data upon changes to the active view a user
is brushing in. To limit view switching times, Falcon initially loads reduced
interactive resolutions, then progressively improves them. Benchmarks show that
Falcon sustains real-time interactivity of 50fps for pixel-level brushing and
linking across multiple visualizations with no costly precomputation. We show
constant brushing performance regardless of data size on datasets ranging from
millions of records in the browser to billions when connected to a backing
database system.
