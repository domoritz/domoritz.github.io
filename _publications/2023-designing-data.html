Lack of diversity in data collection has caused significant failures in machine
learning (ML) applications. While ML developers perform post-collection
interventions, these are time intensive and rarely comprehensive. Thus, new
methods to track and manage data collection, iteration, and model training are
necessary for evaluating whether datasets reflect real world variability. We
present designing data, an iterative, bias mitigating approach to data
collection connecting HCI concepts with ML techniques. Our process includes (1)
Pre-Collection Planning, to reflexively prompt and document expected data
distributions; (2) Collection Monitoring, to systematically encourage sampling
diversity; and (3) Data Familiarity, to identify samples that are unfamiliar to
a model through Out-of-Distribution (OOD) methods. We instantiate designing data
through our own data collection and applied ML case study. We find models
trained on “designed” datasets generalize better across intersectional groups
than those trained on similarly sized but less targeted datasets, and that data
familiarity is effective for debugging datasets.
