title: The time I went to Iran
description: A personal story about going to Iran
---

In light of the despicable new legislation in the US that is not only [opposed by](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3167) [academics](https://notoimmigrationban.com/) but also [spontaneously brings thousands of people to sit in at the airport](https://www.facebook.com/events/1152820661482173/), I wanted to give a different, more personal perspective.

I have been to Iran and I feel now is the time to talk about the people that I've met and things I've seen. I like to talk about this trip in person but a friend asked me whether I could write it down to show how this trip changed what I knew about the Middle East.

Before I went, most of what I knew was highly influenced by the media. When I say media, you're probably thinking of news but you also find it in kids movies. For instance, the heros in [Disney's Aladdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)) all speak with a perfect American accent, while the villains are dark-skinned, and foreign accents, and appearance. A lot of the costumes and architecture in the movie comes from north Africa or India. The depiction of the middle east seems highly skewed and is largely inaccurate. What we see in the US makes it seems as though it's not actually a place you can go to; but you can! So let me take you on my trip to the origin of 1001 nights and a place whose history dates back thousands of years.

We went to Iran in spring 2015. After being on a plane for countless hours, we arrived in the international airport in Tehran. I did not have a visa before I got there because as a German citizen I could get a Visa on entry. Today, [citizens from most countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Iran) can get a tourist visa on entry.

## Nowruz

My visit was during the time of the Persian New Year [Nowruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz). Nowruz is on the day of the vernal equinox; the time when the sun is exactly above the equator. The Iranian calendar actually makes a lot more sense than the Gregorian calendar. It is observation based, rather than rule based and is thus [more accurate](http://aramis.obspm.fr/~heydari/divers/ir-cal-eng.html). The first 6 months have 31 days, the next 5 months have 30, and the last month has 29 or 30.

Nowruz is the biggest celebration of the year and many people go on vacation. For me, this meant that many tourist attractions would be more crowded but also public places would be more lively. Besides spending time with family or going on vacation, families and some public places would traditionally have a *Haft-Seen* table with seven things that start with a letter *Seen* (sounds like S).

## People and Places in Tehran

Everyone in Tehran made me feel incredibly welcome. Yes, I am studying in the US and the sanctions that made it impossible to import anything from the US would be enough reason to be suspicious but I experienced the opposite. People were curious and asked me about my studies, my hobbies, and favorite foods. Everyone I met was incredibly nice and genuinely curious.

Spring in Tehran was different from what I expected. Somehow I expected it to be hot and try but Tehran is high up with the northern part reaching into the Alborz mountains; it actually snowed one day. Besides the climate, I was also impressed by how large the city was. There are about the same number of people in Tehran as in New York City! As you can see in the image below, the city extends as far as we could see that day.

One of the first things we visited in Tehran was the market at [Tajrish Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajrish#Tajrish_Bazaar), a place that attracts all senses. There are stands with large heaps of spices, nuts, dried and fresh fruit. Another thing I liked were little wooden boxes made with mother of pearl and beautiful carpets. The market was lively but well organized. Tajrish square was actually one of my favorite places to visit because I like to see places that are part of the everyday life.

Of course, we also visited more touristy places. We went to Golestan Palace, a former royal palace in Tehran. It's a fascinating place with walls covered in mirrors and masterfully ornamented doors. Other places I've visited but don't have the time to talk about are the Sa'd Abad Complex, the national museum of Tehran, the time museum, and some others that I don't recount the names of.

One of the odd things I noticed when we walked through the streets were satellite dishes on the roofs of many houses. Although satellite TV is banned in Iran. However, [most people](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/iran-destroys-100000-corrupting-satellite-dishes-160724202722493.html) have satellite TV and even Rouhani said the ban is unnecessary and counterproductive. This is exemplar of the discrepancy between image and reality; modern Iranians are fashionable, progressive, and well-educated but at the same time the hijab is mandatory and the Internet is heavily censored.

## Going to Shiraz

From Tehran I took a plane from the second (smaller) airport in Tehran to Shiraz in the south. Shiraz is known for its gardens, mosques, and above all Persepolis!

With two friends who were eager to show me the exciting places in Shiraz, I first visited Eram Garden. It is one of the [UNESCO world heritage sites](http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ir). Besides being a pretty garden, there is also a beautiful house with mirrors and wooden doors that you can see below.

Shiraz is also home to Hafez and Saadi, two of the finest poets. I visited their tombs and as you can see below in my picture of Hafez' tomb, so did a lot of other people that day. Hafez and Saadi had a huge influence on Persian culture and literature worldwide. I learned that Goethe, the most well known German poet, was fascinated by their poems and writing.

A special food that is hard to find outside of Shiraz and loved my Iranian's is Faloodeh. It's a dessert of noodles made from corn starch mixed in a semi-frozen syrup made from sugar and rose water. People usually have it with lime juice. It's very cold and a bit crunchy. We had Faloodeh on the [bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vakil_Bazaar) that has beautiful courtyards and a brick vault ceiling.

Another fascinating thing I've seen in Shiraz is the [Nasir ol Molk Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_ol_Molk_Mosque). From the courtyard you can see the most amazing painted arches. Inside, the stained glass submerges the room in a bath of colorful light. The best time to go in the morning but I went there later in the day so the picture below does not quite convey what it can look like.

The most amazing thing in Shiraz is actually outside of Shiraz. We had to drive a bit through the desert to get to Takht-e-Jamshid, *the throne of Jamshid* or [Persepolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis). If you haven't heard about it, Persepolis is the capital of the  Achaemenid that existed over 2000 years ago. Most of the main structures were built by Darius I, Xerxes I, and Artaxerxes I; large parts of it into rock. It's hard to even describe all the fascinating things about this place. We have to thank a coincidence that we can see it today: In 330 BC, Alexander the Great attacked Persepolis and destroyed large parts of it. After that, the place was forgotten and was covered by sand until modern times. Only because of that, the place has been unaltered for centuries.

The stone structures as well as the reliefs are simply breathtaking and I am so happy to have seen it. Below are two pictures that show the main site and one of the reliefs.

At Persepolis, there are many depictions of Farvahars, which symbolize good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; the basic principles of [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism).

## Iranian Foods

{% include image.html name="sangak.jpg" caption="Sangak is a flatbread baked on pebble stones." %}

Besides the many spices and dried fruit (figs and white mulberries), one of my favorite foods was Sangak, a large leavened flatbread that is baked on pebble stones and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The pebbles give the bread characteristic holes. The bread is great with jam or some soft cheese. Of course, it's best when it's fresh. Another thing I really liked was Haleem, a wheat stew that my friend's mom made for us.

Most of the main meals in Iran were a combination of flatbread, vegetables, grilled meat, and yogurt seasoned with various spices. What really surprised me, though, where the size of the portions. I'm used to portions that are way too large from the US but in Iran I found that the portions were too much for me even though I was very active.

One evening, we went to get ice cream in Tehran and to my complete surprise, all labels were in German and not a single word was in Farsi. Somehow there seems to be a thing with German's at ice cream in Iran. When I had saffron ice cream in Shiraz (yes, and yes, it's good), it turned out that the owner spoke fluently in German.

## Conclusions

The short time I spent in Iran definitely made a lasting impression on me. I met people that were helpful and incredibly friendly. Not a single moment, I felt unsafe or out of place. I felt welcome and everybody I met appreciated my curiosity to learn more. After all, when I have curious people visit the place I live in, I want them to feel welcome.

In this report I only touched on a few things about the country and people of Iran. I definitely want to go back some day and get to know it better. It's time we think of nations and countries as people and be curious and learn about each other. Then, and only then, we will overcome the polarization and the walls in our heads.
