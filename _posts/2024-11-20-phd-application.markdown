Here is my n=1 perspective on applying for a PhD in computer science at a research University. I think a PhD is awesome. It allows you to grow into a world-class researcher, push the boundaries of human knowledge, and connect with an international research community.

If you want to do a PhD with me---awesome---please apply to the <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction Institute">HCII</abbr> at <abbr title="Carnegie Mellon University">CMU</abbr>. I am looking forward to your application especially if you are from a non-traditional background! If you are curious about some general background on a PhD, read [this comprehensive summary](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf). If you email me about your application, note that I [may be unable to respond](https://talkingtorobots.com/FAQ.html).

The PhD application process at top CS departments is highly competitive so it may help you to understand what I am prioritizing. Professor Eugene Wu has written about [goal-oriented applications](http://eugenewu.net/tips.html). The point I want to highlight is that your research statement should not be about what you have done or how my research interests you. It should provide evidence that you can do research in [my lab](https://dig.cmu.edu) and convince me that you can maximize our research impact compared to other candidates. In practical terms, this means showing evidence of research potential (e.g., publications, research experience), describing a research vision, and getting strong recommendation letters. Professor Mike Ernst has [great advice on applying to grad school](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/apply-grad-school.html).

Make sure you understand the admission process which differs between universities. For example, at the HCII, the department rather than the individual faculty decides on admission. Individual faculty still have a say in the admission so make sure to mention them in your application. You can learn more about [how the HCII process works](https://hcii.cmu.edu/academics/phd-hci/admissions).

Professor Lace Padilla has a great [YouTube series on how to prepare an application and thrive in academia](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9dkYfBBHFkJUmqluDocwGuxaZ3y5Zkm). Other faculty will have their own advice.

There is a lot of advice once you are in a PhD program on how to become a successful researcher but that's for another day.
